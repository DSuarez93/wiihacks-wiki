# Posting Guidelines.

  The [wiki entry](https://{{ site.data.const.url }}/posting), and the stickied post are to remain in sync with this document.

----

## Rules.

   * Please read [the subreddit's rules](https://{{ site.data.const.url }}/rules) before posting or replying.

## NO PIRACY.

   * Don't ask or tell where to find pirated games. Don't post about pirating games in any way shape or form. It violates rule #3.

## Questions:

   * Search first. If you ask a question that can easily be found via a subreddit search, it'll be removed.

   * If you're wondering where to start and are about to make a post to ask about it;

     [The Recommended Guide](https://wii.guide/).
   
     [The WiiHacks Wiki F.A.Q.](https://{{ site.data.const.url }}/faqs)

   * If you're posting a request for help please be helpful in your request and provide as much information as you can. Even if you have already, go back and re-read rule #4 if you plan to ask for help.

   * Also, if you're posting a help request, please make sure you've searched the subreddit for a solution and made an effort to find the resolution before you make a post.

   * If you post a help request or question, try to update it with the solution if one is found.

## Post Not Showing up?

   * If you post something that doesn't show up, be patient. Questionable links need to be approved as well as everything new accounts posts. If you've waited what you consider a reasonable amount of time, send a message to modmail.

## Mod Help Needed?

   * Finally, don't PM the moderators on subreddit related issues. That is what modmail is for. Doing so is a quick way to get ignored and banned.
