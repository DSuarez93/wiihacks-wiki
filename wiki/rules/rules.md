# Rules for r/WiiHacks Users

  Any rule violation can result in your post being removed, or you being banned depending on the context of the violation. Continually violating a rule will get you banned. If you have questions regarding the rules or bans, please feel free to message the moderators via modmail.

  Posting Guidelines can be found [here](./posting.md).

1. Be Civil

   [Reddit has strict policies against bullying and harassing](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully). You are expected to act civil towards one and another. No abuse, bullying, harassing, antagonistic behavior etc, will be tolerated.

2. No Spam

   Webster's defines spam as : unsolicited usually commercial messages (such as e-mails, text messages, or Internet postings) sent to a large number of recipients or posted in a large number of places.

   Bots that serve no real function and annoy users will be banned.

3. No Piracy

   Please limit your posts and responses to modding your Wii. Posts and comments that imply, hint, or state out-right intentions of piracy and/or any other illegal activity will not be tolerated. The post or comment if seen by a mod will be removed. Do it more than once and we'll remove your ability to post.

   Havens for piracy are often targeted by certain console/game manufacturers. Being known as one puts the community at risk. If you see a link or discussion regarding piracy, please report it.

4. No Low-Effort Help Requests

   Since r/WiiHacks is constantly being bombarded with help requests, we ask that you have enough courtesy to provide everyone with the information that is required to help you fix your issue.

   Please don't post questions not directly related to modifying your Wii. We're not responsible for teaching you how to use your computer or the applications needed to run it. Please don't insult us by asking.

   This will be judged on a post-by-post basis depending on the issue and what information is given. Posts that have the timber of "I have a problem, help me fix it!" and give nothing else will be removed.

   When you request help please try to post as much information regarding the issue as possible, and as neatly as possible. Normal rules of etiquette apply.

   Lastly, please try to make the title of your post intuitive, brief, but as descriptive as possible. Try to include key software, and a clear description of the issue.

   Your post will qualify as low effort if:

   * your post is in all caps or a wall of text.
   * your title has nothing to actually do with your issue. Just that you have one.
   * there's no information in it and you have to be asked everything.
   * someone makes a suggestion, and you reply that you've already done it and you hadn't mentioned it until then.
   * we have information in the wiki regarding your specific problem and you haven't gone through them yet.
   * searching google/ddg or even in the subreddit can locate a solution that you haven't tried.
   * your main issue is you want someone to do something for you.

   This list is not exhaustive, but meant to give you examples of what will be removed. Keep missing the mark after being given a warning and you'll be given a ban.

# Bans and Circumventing Bans

  Bans will be determined by the type and magnitude of violation and whether or not its a repeated occurance.

  All spambots will be banned permanently.

  We know that accounts are anonymous. We expect people to circumvent bans by creating new accounts. We will ban the new account if a) it violates a rule that warrants it, and b) we discover you're circumventing the ban.

  You will also be reported to reddit for violating their [Site-Wide Rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-ban-evasion).
