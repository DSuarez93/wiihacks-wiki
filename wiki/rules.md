# Rules for r/WiiHacks

Any rule violation can result in your post being removed, or you being banned depending on the context of the violation. Continually violating a rule will get you banned. If you have questions regarding the rules or bans, please feel free to message the moderators.

## 1. Be Civil

* [Reddit has strict policies against bullying and harassing](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully). You are expected to act civil towards one and another. No abuse, bullying, harassing, antagonistic behavior etc, will be tolerated.

* Maliciously providing information that will harm someone's Wii will not be tolerated.

## 2. No Spam

* Webster's defines spam as : unsolicited usually commercial messages (such as e-mails, text messages, or Internet postings) sent to a large number of recipients or posted in a large number of places.

* Bots that serve no real function and annoy users will be banned.

## 3. No Piracy

* Piracy is NOT supported or tolerated here.

Please limit your posts and responses to modding your Wii. Posts and comments that imply, hint, or state out-right intentions of piracy and/or any other illegal activity will not be tolerated. The post or comment if seen by a mod will be removed. Do it more than once and we'll remove your ability to post.

Havens for piracy are often targeted by certain console/game manufacturers. Being known as one puts the community at risk. If you see a link or discussion regarding piracy, please report it.

## Bans and Circumventing Bans

Bans will be determined by the type and magnitude of violation and whether or not its a repeated occurance.

All spambots will be banned permanently.

We know that accounts are anonymous. We expect people to circumvent bans by creating new accounts. We will ban the new account if a) it violates a rule that warrants it, and b) we discover you're circumventing the ban.

You will also be reported to reddit for violating their [Site-Wide Rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-ban-evasion).
