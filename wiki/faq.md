## Questions...

### My games aren't loading! Why?

There are many, many reasons why this can happen.

Recently there's been a growing number of posts where loading games off of an SD, and even more so, USB Sticks, has caused issues loading games.

Before you post, please try a different brand and type of storage media.

Also if you're using USB Loader GX, please try the troubleshooting guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WiiHacks/comments/dnfb81/usb_loader_gx_troubleshooting_guide/)

### How do I play Wii Backups after I've modded my Wii?

[USB Loader GX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbloadergx/) plays your Wii backups. Dont forget to grab the forwarder channel too.

----

### How do I manage my virtual Wii game library?

Use [WiiBackupManager](http://www.wiibackupmanager.co.uk/WiiBackupManager_Build78.html) to get proper folder structure, gameID and to split large game files.

----

### How do I get WADs and Channel forwarders onto my Wii?

[YAWMM](https://github.com/FIX94/Some-YAWMM-Mod) is a great way to easily install wad files and channel forwarders.

----

### How do I know the current mod/cios state of my Wii?

Currently [SysCheck](http://www.hacksden.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=149) is recommended.

----

### I've botched the process, but my Wii still seems to work, what do I do?

To answer a common question on botched installs; NO you do not have to undo anything. As long as your Wii is still (mostly) functional, find some help, start the modding process over. You (almost) never need to undo what you've already done.

----

### Can I Un-MOD my Wii? Will formatting it remove the mods?

Simply put; No. It can be done to an extent, but there are some things you will never undo. 

If you want to un-mod your Wii because your current mod job is causing problems, find a better tutorial, start over.

Formatting it will remove all the cosmetics, but it won't remove the modded cIOS(s).
