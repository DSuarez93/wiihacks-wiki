# Rules of the Forum

If you have questions regarding the rules or bans, please feel free to message the moderators.

## Social Conduct

* You are expected to act civil towards one and another. No abuse, bullying, harassing, antagonistic behavior etc. It won't be tolerated.

* Spam won't be tolerated.

* Maliciously providing information that will harm someone's Wii will also not be tolerated.

* [Reddit has strict policies against bullying and harassing](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully). If you're breaking them, you're breaking this rule.

## Piracy

* Piracy is NOT supported or tolerated here.

Please limit your posts and responses to modding your Wii. Posts and comments that imply, hint, or state out-right intentions of piracy and/or any other illegal activity will be removed. The post or comment if seen by a mod will be removed. Do it more than once and we'll remove your ability to post.

If you see a link or discussion regarding piracy, please report it. The more this forum is known to be a bastion of piracy, the less chance it has of surviving.

To clarifiy: Piracy != Breaking Terms of Service.

Pirating intellectual property is not the same as violating a company's terms of service. The former has a chance of landing you in jail, the latter could at most result in a civil suit with a fine (in the USA anyway). Piracy goes directly against the forum rules. Violating a TOS does not.

Luckily this greatly simplifies what you as a poster needs to remember about piracy and this forum. Piracy is simply theft. Don't talk about stealing something, whether you've done it, or are going to do it. If you have obtained what you're talking about in a way the law would consider stealing, you're violating the piracy rule.

Talking about violating a company's TOS with your legally obtained equipment and software does not violate this rule. If it did, there'd be no reason for this forum to exist.

## Bans

As moderators, we are not obligated to inform you when you break the rules. However if we notice that someone has, we'll take action and take note. The situation will determine if a notification is sent regarding it.

All spambots will be banned on sight, permanently.

Bans will happen with or without notification for egregious or repeated offenders of the above outlined rules.

## Circumventing Bans

* Circumventing bans in any manner won't be tolerated.

We know that accounts are anonymous. We expect people to circumvent bans by creating new accounts. We will ban the new account if a) it violates a rule that warrants it, and b) we discover you're circumventing the ban.
