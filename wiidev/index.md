# Welcome to r/WiiHack's HomeBrew Development Corner!

Here we've tried to compile enough information to allow anyone to get started with developing homebrew applications on the Wii.

## Getting Started

Here on the [Getting Started](/r/WiiHacks/wiki/wiidev/gettingstarted) page you will learn the basics on setting up a development environment, and what you either should know, or what you'll be up against learning if you decide to make your own homebrew application.
